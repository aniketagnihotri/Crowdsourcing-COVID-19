                        <b>Mission Statement</b><br />
                        Intended to incentivize safe tourism and travel to and in Indianapolis, Indigo is your go-to for all things COVID-19.
                        Our goal is to make changes and other information more accessible to the public via crowdsourced business ratings
                        and business-specific data. In a time of uncertainty, we feel that this is the best way to educate our users as
                        Indiana slowly reopens.
                        <br /><br />

                        <b>Why Indigo?</b><br />
                        At the core, Indigo is an application that has taken a Yelp-like approach to crowdsourcing business data via ratings and reviews;
                        Indigo adds various other features to the mix as well to ensure that our users are well-informed and safe in Indianapolis.<br /><br />
                        Indigo allows users to look into different restaurants, hotels, airlines, tours, and other attractions and the safety protocols
                        that they have each implemented to combat COVID-19. Indigoâ€™s reviews system allows users to receive an understanding of others'
                        first-hand experiences at these locations before committing to traveling there.
                        <br /><br />

                        <b>Our Customer Base</b><br />
