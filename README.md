# Indigo

Visit the deployment of indigo at https://indigo04.herokuapp.com. The process may have to re-compile and execute if the dyno is asleep, which takes approx. 3 minutes.

### Note
Given the limitations of the free Heroku dyno that Indigo is currently hosted on, you may encounter a white page. Please note that this white page is temporary, as it is due to the inavailability of RAM on the dyno; the issue will fix itself within five minutes.

### Purpose
Indigo is a go-to for all things COVID-19, intended to incentivize safe tourism and travel to and in Indianapolis. THe goal of Indigo is to make changes and other information more accessible to the public via crowdsourced business ratings and business-specific data. In a time of uncertainty, we feel that this is the best way to educate our users as Indiana slowly reopens.
